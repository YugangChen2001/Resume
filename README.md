Users can access media data results and articles using the DigiClips Search Engine. Specifically, when clients give DigiClips keywords or other details about what they want tracked. A back-end audio and video recording that gives information for television and radio is supplemented by search engines. I act as a team leader in our project team. To make sure that our team was headed in the correct direction, I gave the team members responsibilities and engaged in active communication with sponsors. I planned and scheduled a weekly team meeting to assess how our project was coming along. Our team's responsibility is to graphically display the website's back-end data.
